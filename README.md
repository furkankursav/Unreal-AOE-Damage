>From grenades to bloodthirsty spells throwing meteors from the sky! AoE meaning stands mainly for _“Area of Effect”_. It is a set of codes organized with their names and functions that define the range of attacks or spells. In other words, an attack, spell or function of your character **affects an area**, rather than just affecting one or more targets specifically or randomly.
